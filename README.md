## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Pristine](https://pristine.js.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a really challenging callenge for me, to be honest. I have learned more about validation, dates in js and test-scenarios. I have learned that there is so much more to learn about JS

### Continued development

I deffinetly need to learn about promises and async functions. I wanted to make animation to go one after another, but i only managed to do so with setTimeouts, which is not a good practice, i suppose.


### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/animating-number-counters/) - here i have found how to animate numbers change
- https://pristine.js.org/ - validator that i used, and it is great! it would be so much longer to validate all the scenarios i wanted without it
